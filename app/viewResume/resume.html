      I bring an adventurous spirit to every project, searching out and embracing changing requirements to ensure things aren't only done, but done well.  I relish the challenges of dynamic development, and strive to keep my enthusiasm infectious.

    I bring an unyielding drive to find the best technologies and practices, honed to a razor edge by my time working for the US Navy.  Despite the bureacracy of an organization which officially moved from IE8 to 10 less than a year ago, my teammates and I pioneered the adoption of AngularJS, CoffeeScript, and a test driven development cycle, building a modern webapp to replace outdated desktop software.  We collaborated using Confluence, recording processes and pitfalls to ensure that future developers will have the tools they need to continue to deliver value every sprint.

      I bring the passion of a lifelong advocate of the gaming community.  As a gamer, I have a deep understanding of the player perspective, and am devoted to ensuring every player's experience is not only positive, but mind-blowing.  My passion for games is integral to who I am, and I love to share that passion.  I step up to the plate to create great gaming experiences, from running small tabletop games to keeping my university gaming club alive when all hope seemed lost.  I just couldn't bear to see something as amazing as Humans vs Zombies die.  By the way, if you've never faced down fifty screaming zombies with naught between you and them but resolve and a plastic toy, I highly recommend you find a nearby game and try it out.  Better yet, make me part of the team and we can start a local one. ;) I am also quite inspired by Riot's drive to reform toxic behavior, and will fight to encourage diversity and respect both in esports, and the gaming community at large.

      I bring experience maintaining complex web applications with tens of thousands of users. I've been working as a programmer for three years now, and I can adapt to whatever programming environment I happen to find myself in.  I'm comfortable working with Unix based and Windows systems, using a variety of languages, systems, and development tools.  I prefer not to tie myself down to a specific language or system, programming is programming.
